NOTE: Your original permit_data.py file is too large to include here directly.

When you set up the backend, you'll need to:
1. Copy your permit_data.py file (the one with all the requirements.py content)
2. Place it in the backend/ folder
3. Make sure it has these functions that the API uses:
   - get_city_key(city_name)
   - get_permit_types(city_key) 
   - get_permit_requirements(city_key, permit_type)

Your file already has all of these! Just copy it over as-is.
